# Video Processing and Deposition Analysis

This project processes a video to calculate the length of material deposition and estimate the efficiency of the deposition process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

2. **Place the video file in the appropriate directory:**

   Ensure the video file is located at the specified path in the code.

## Code Explanation

### Input

- The code begins by taking the height of deposition as input from the user.
  
### Background Subtraction

- A background subtractor object is created using OpenCV's `createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2`.

### Video Capture

- The video file is opened using OpenCV's `VideoCapture`.

### Feedrate Extraction

- The feedrate is extracted from the filename using a regular expression.

### Frame Rate and Duration Calculation

- The frame rate (fps) and total number of frames are obtained from the video.
- The total duration of the video is calculated in seconds.

### Deposition Length Calculation

- The length of the deposition is calculated using the feedrate and video duration.

### Frame Processing Function

- `process_frame(frame)`: This function processes each frame to isolate black areas and draw contours around them.

### Main Loop

- The main loop reads each frame of the video, applies background subtraction, processes the frame, and displays the processed frame.
- The loop breaks if the 'q' key is pressed.

### Final Calculations

- The final area is calculated by summing the contour areas of each frame.
- The volume of spatter and deposition are calculated.
- The efficiency of the deposition process is estimated.

### Output

- The results, including final area, volume of spatter, volume of deposition, and efficiency, are printed to the console.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Modify the `video_path` variable to the path of your video file.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to input the height of deposition.

## Notes

- The `process_frame` function uses specific HSV values to isolate black areas. These values might need to be adjusted based on the characteristics of your video.
- The script is designed to process a specific format of filenames to extract feedrate. Ensure your filename follows the format `...feedrate-XX...`.

## Example Output

```
Enter the height: 10
The feedrate is: 45
Duration of video: 30 seconds
Length of the deposition: 22.5
Final area is: 0.012
Volume of spatter: 0.004
Volume of deposition: 150.796
The efficiency is: 0.00003
```
